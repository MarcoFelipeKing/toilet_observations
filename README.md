Project: Modeling Surface Contact Patterns and Pathogen Transmission in Public Toilets

Objective:
To develop a stochastic model of human-surface interactions in public toilets to understand potential pathogen transmission pathways and evaluate infection risks.

Key Components:

1. Behavioral Data Collection:
- Observed sequences of surface touches in public toilets
- Three toilet types: Men's, Women's, Gender-neutral
- Three activities: Urination, Defecation, Menstrual hygiene management
- Hand use (left/right/both) recorded
- Surface categories: Entry, Cubicle, Hygiene, Personal items

2. Markov Chain Model:
- Higher-order Markov chains to capture realistic behavior sequences
- Location-based state machine (Entry -> Cubicle -> Hygiene -> Exit)
- Personal item interrupts (phone, clothing)
- Activity-specific patterns
- Spatial constraints (can't touch outside surfaces when in locked cubicle)

3. Pathogen Transfer Model:
- Surface-to-hand and hand-to-surface transfer
- Concentration gradient-based transfer
- Surface contact area fraction
- Hand hygiene effectiveness (log-normal distribution)
- Handwashing compliance (Bernoulli distribution)

4. Validation:
- Statistical comparison of generated vs observed sequences
- Length distributions (KS test)
- Transition patterns (Chi-square test)
- Network visualization of contact patterns

Future Development Needs:
1. Activity-specific surface contamination patterns
2. Time-dependent pathogen decay on surfaces
3. Multiple user interactions over time
4. Environmental factors (humidity, temperature)
5. Different pathogen types (virus, bacteria)

Example Usage:
```python
# Initialize model with data
model = EnhancedToiletModelWithValidation("clean_contact_data.csv")

# Generate and validate sequences
validation_results = model.validate_sequences(n_samples=1000)

# Simulate contamination
sequence, metadata = model.generate_sequence("Urination", "Gender neutral")
contamination = model.simulate_contamination(
    sequence,
    initial_surface_contamination=100,
    transfer_efficiency=0.1,
    surface_contact_fraction=0.1
)
```

Key Questions to Address:
1. How do different activities affect transmission risk?
2. What role do personal items play in pathogen spread?
3. How effective are current hand hygiene practices?
4. Which surfaces pose the highest transmission risk?
5. How do different toilet types compare in terms of risk?

The model aims to provide insights for:
- Public health interventions
- Toilet design improvements
- Hand hygiene protocols
- Surface cleaning strategies
- Risk assessment

Would you like me to elaborate on any particular aspect?
